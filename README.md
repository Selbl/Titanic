Prediction of survival for Titanic passengers using four machine learning techniques: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machines

This is my take on predicting survival of Titanic passengers using the database from Kaggle (link)[https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic]. I present my exploratory data analysis with handling of missing values for relevant categories and my implementation of four machine learning techniques along with their respective hyperparameter tuning.
