# Titanic
Prediction of survival for Titanic passengers using Python and Jupyter Notebboks. I implement four machine learning techniques for prediction: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours and Support Vector Machines

This is my take on predicting survival of Titanic passengers using the database from Kaggle found in the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). I present my exploratory data analysis with handling of missing values for relevant categories and my implementation of four machine learning techniques along with their respective hyperparameter tuning.
